# AVOCADO_Bot
## C++ code built in the Arduino IDE, and using some Mbed functions, for a mobile differential drive robot which can solve a simple maze.

The AVOCADO bot, or **Automatic Vehicle Odometry Cartography And Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance** Bot, is a differential drive robot which uses an Arduino Nano 33 BLE microcontroller, two motors, three ultra sonic sensors, and two Infrared sensors to solve a simple maze using a left wall following algorithm.

[Please see these slides for a summary of the design philosophy, physical chassis design, and the maze solving algorithm](Robotics_Design_and_Construction_Presentation_2025.pdf)
